Issue date: September 11, 2017



Introduction

Reportal is an application that aims to assist the Stevens community by providing an easy way for students to report issues on campus. The application will have two main interfaces, one for the students and the other is for the maintenance team.

The student’s interface will allow students to report in campus issues such as, infrastructural issues, service issues, etc. through the application. They will also be able to post a picture of the damaged item, provide a description and location of the reported issue. The application will also allow students to receive alerts about the status of their reported issues. Application will be available on Android platform for Students.

As for the maintenance team, there will be a web portal which will allow the team to check reported issues and assign them to maintenance personnel. A history of the resolved and remaining issues will be maintained through this portal.
